        The piano sat silently in the corner of the room. Nobody could remember
        the last time it had been played. The little girl walked up to it and
        hit a few of the keys. The sound of the piano rang throughout the house
        for the first time in years. In the upstairs room, confined to her bed,
        the owner of the house had tears in her eyes.

        There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming.
        In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been
        years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement
        that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left
        him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his
        comfort zone.

        They needed to find a place to eat. The kids were beginning to get
        grumpy in the back seat and if they didn't find them food soon, it was
        just a matter of time before they were faced with a complete meltdown.
        Even knowing this, the solution wasn't easy. Everyone in the car had a
        different opinion on where the best place to eat would be with nobody
        agreeing with the suggestions of the others. It seemed to be an
        impossible no-win situation where not everyone would be happy no matter
        where they decided to eat which in itself would lead to a meltdown. Yet
        a decision needed to be made and it needed to be made quickly.

        There was something special about this little creature. Donna couldn't
        quite pinpoint what it was, but she knew with all her heart that it was
        true. It wasn't a matter of if she was going to try and save it, but a
        matter of how she was going to save it. She went back to the car to get
        a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone.
